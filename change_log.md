### Version 1.0.0

- Optional parameters `--chloe_project_dir` and `--chloe_project_name` have been removed. PAV now expects the path to the Chloe project directory as a required positional argument to `pav annotate_and_check`. PAV no longer checks for the Chloe project directory in $CONDA_PREFIX/bin.
- Added path resolution for the PAV data directory, as setup for a conda package install.
- Set 'spawn' as multiprocessing start method for Linux, to avoid listener thread locks causing program hang
- Capture KeyboardInterrupt when running program to ensure listener thread shutdown on exit
